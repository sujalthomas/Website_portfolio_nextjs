### Yarn next build

### Yarn next start

### 5. Hook up contact form
Due to the variety of options available for contact form providers, I've hooked up the contact form only so far as handling inputs and state. Form submission and the actual sending of the email is open to your own implementation. My personal recommendation for email provider is [Sendgrid.](https://sendgrid.com/)


### 7. Deploy to Vercel and enjoy your new Resume Website

Deploying your new site to Vercel is simple, and can be done by following their guide [here.](https://vercel.com/guides/deploying-nextjs-with-vercel) When you're all done and the build succeeds, you should be given a url for your live site, go there and you'll see your new personal resume website! Congratulations!
