## 🚀 **Get Started**

1. **Prerequisites** 🛠
   Ensure you've installed the latest stable versions of Node and Yarn on your machine.

2. **Clone & Setup** 📥 
   Fork this repository for your own version! Not sure about forking? Then, download the forked repo to your machine.

3. **Install & Run** 💼
   Navigate to the repo's root in your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   yarn dev
   ```
   The project should now be live at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

4. **Customize** 🎨
   All website content is sourced from `/src/data/data.tsx`. Simply adjust this file's content to reflect your details. Changes will be reflected immediately upon saving. Relevant data types are in `dataDef.ts`, and sample images are stored under `src/images/`.

5. **Contact Form** 💌
   The contact form is prepped to handle inputs & state, but you'll need to implement the sending functionality. Sendgrid comes highly recommended.
