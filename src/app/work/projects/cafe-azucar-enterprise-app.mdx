## Overview

As part of the Enterprise Software course at SJSU, I led the development of a sophisticated coffee store management platform. The project focused on creating a scalable, cloud-native solution that could handle complex cashier operations while maintaining robust security and high availability.

## Key Features

- **Secure Administrative System**: Implemented comprehensive admin login and management capabilities with role-based access control.
- **Order Processing Pipeline**: Developed an efficient order management system with real-time processing and status tracking.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Deployed on Google Cloud Platform with load balancing for optimal performance and reliability.
- **Message Queue Integration**: Implemented RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing and improved system resilience.
- **Secure API Gateway**: Designed and implemented API routing with Kong Gateway, featuring robust API key authentication.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Java
- **Database**: Cloud MySQL
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ
- **Cloud Services**: Google Cloud Platform
- **API Gateway**: Kong
- **Authentication**: API Key Authentication
- **Load Balancing**: GCP Load Balancer
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## Challenges and Learnings

The primary challenge was designing a system that could handle high-volume transactions while maintaining data consistency across distributed services. Implementing message queuing with RabbitMQ required careful consideration of failure scenarios and retry mechanisms. Additionally, setting up the Kong API Gateway with proper security measures demanded extensive testing and configuration optimization.

## Outcome

The platform successfully streamlined coffee store operations by providing a robust, scalable solution for order management. The implementation of cloud services and message queuing enabled the system to handle peak loads efficiently, while the secure API gateway ensured safe integration with mobile apps and storefront systems. The project demonstrated enterprise-grade architecture principles and best practices in cloud-native development.
