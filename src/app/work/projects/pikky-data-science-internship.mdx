## Overview

At Pikky, I developed a sophisticated food recommendation system that leverages collaborative filtering and machine learning to provide personalized suggestions to users. The project focused on analyzing user behavior patterns and food preferences to deliver highly accurate recommendations.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Recommendation Algorithm**: Implemented collaborative filtering using Python and TensorFlow, achieving a 22% improvement in recommendation accuracy.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created comprehensive feature sets from user profiles, dietary preferences, and restaurant menu data to enhance the ML model's prediction capabilities.
- **Data Visualization**: Developed interactive dashboards using PowerBI to present key insights on user preferences and trending cuisines.
- **Performance Optimization**: Implemented efficient data processing pipelines to handle large-scale user interaction data.

## Technologies Used

- **ML/Data Science**: Python, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Visualization**: PowerBI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Analysis Tools**: Jupyter Notebooks
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was developing an algorithm that could effectively handle the cold start problem for new users while maintaining high accuracy for existing users. This required implementing a hybrid approach combining content-based and collaborative filtering methods. Additionally, processing and analyzing large amounts of user interaction data required careful optimization of our data pipelines.

## Outcome

The recommendation system significantly improved user engagement by providing more relevant food suggestions. The 22% improvement in recommendation accuracy led to increased user satisfaction and higher retention rates. The insights generated through PowerBI visualizations helped the product team make data-driven decisions for future feature development.
