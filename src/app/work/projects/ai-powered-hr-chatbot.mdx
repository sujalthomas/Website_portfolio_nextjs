## Overview

At Stu Biz Solutions, I played a key role in developing an AI-powered conversational chatbot for the HR department. The project focused on creating an intelligent system capable of handling HR-related inquiries efficiently while maintaining natural conversation flow.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Language Understanding**: Implemented DeBERTa for sophisticated sequence classification, enabling nuanced understanding of employee queries.
- **Comprehensive NLP Pipeline**: Developed multiple NLP models including Text Classification, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Part of Speech (POS) Tagging.
- **Intelligent Response System**: Utilized advanced word embedding models (BOW, TF-IDF, word2vec) and text similarity techniques for accurate response generation.
- **Conversational AI**: Created natural dialogue flows with context awareness and personalized responses.

## Technologies Used

- **AI/ML**: DeBERTa, TensorFlow
- **NLP**: Text Classification, NER, POS Tagging
- **Text Processing**: BOW, TF-IDF, word2vec
- **Similarity Metrics**: Cosine Similarity
- **Development**: Python, Machine Learning frameworks

## Challenges and Learnings

The primary challenge was achieving high accuracy in understanding context-dependent queries while maintaining natural conversation flow. This required extensive experimentation with different NLP models and techniques. Another significant challenge was optimizing the response time while using sophisticated models like DeBERTa.

## Outcome

The chatbot successfully automated routine HR inquiries, providing quick and accurate responses to employee questions. The implementation of advanced NLP techniques resulted in more natural and context-aware conversations, significantly improving the user experience and reducing the workload on the HR team.
